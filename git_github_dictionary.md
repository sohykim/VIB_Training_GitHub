# git_github_dictionary



Git and Github is not the same. They are complementory!



## What is Git repository?

Versioning system that keeps track of changes, allows to go back for previous versions, allows for collaboration, and *locally stored*.



## What is a Github?

It is a online repository (back up place for your Git project) in a server where all these commitments and the logged history is saved and tracked. As it is saved in the cloud (<-> locally saved), my project will still stay even after my computer crashes. Moreover, we can access to other's files and look back to our codes.


# 4 Conceptual Areas

# 3 Conceptual Areas

- **Developing area:** working directory
- **Staging area:** temporary space between two areas
- **Local repository:** where snapshots (timepoint is saved)



* **Remote repository (GitHub)**: back-up space in clouds.

# Starting my Git timeline

## Initialise your Git by using `git init`

```Go to your working directory
cd /Users/sohyungkim/Desktop/Workspace/VIB_Training/Github
```



When writing a commit, you have to include why was it changed, how this addresses the issue, and the effects due to the change. Most importantly, you should mention limitation of the change, meaning that you should mention if your changes are complete or not. Be as descriptive as possible!!!

```
# Saves the update version (snapshot/point in time) in git repo
git commit -m "meaningful msg"
```



## Saving a timepoint by using `git commit -m [message]`
